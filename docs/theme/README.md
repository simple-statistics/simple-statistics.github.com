# documentation-theme-default

![](screenshot.png)

This is the default theme for [documentationjs](https://github.com/documentationjs):
it consists of Handlebars templates and a few assets: a [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
theme and [basscss](http://www.basscss.com/) as a basic CSS framework.

This is bundled by default in documentation: it is the default theme.
