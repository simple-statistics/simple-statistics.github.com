      These are special versions of methods that assume your input
      is sorted. This assumptions lets them run a lot faster, usually
      in O(1).

      Breaks methods split datasets into chunks. Often these are used
      for segmentation or visualization of a dataset. A method of computing
      breaks that splits data evenly can make for a better choropleth map,
      for instance, because each color will be represented equally.
